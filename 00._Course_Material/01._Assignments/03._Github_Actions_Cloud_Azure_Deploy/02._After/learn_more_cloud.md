# [Highly_Optional] Learn about more cloud services and set them up in the portal

This is just a set of resources if you are interested in learning more beyond the curriculum. 

None of this is covered in the course or will be brought up at the exam.

Setup Azure SQL.
Connect to it through your local terminal. 
Bonus: Connect through your programming language of choice. 

## Networking Services | Virtual Network, VPN Gateway, CDN, Load Balancer, App GW

Watch the video. Set up a virtual network by following it.

Create Azure CDN and put the following static content on it served in multiple regions:
- image(s) 
- index.html (that contains a link to the image(s))

Bonus: Look into VPN Gateways, API Gateways and Load Balancers in Azure. Extra bonus would be to set them up. 

## Azure Key Vault

Setup secrets in Azure Key Vault.

Get those secrets in GitHub Actions:

Bonus: Try to get those secrets in another Azure service, for instance Azure Functions. 

**Remember**: Delete everything after use. The default SQL instance will consume all of your credit in no time.
